# Little World Frontend Shared Library

This repository contains a comprehensive library of shared elements for Little World's frontend applications to consume from. This includes our React Native mobile app and other frontend applications.

## What This Library Contains

This shared library provides the following elements that can be consumed by Little World's frontend applications:

### Core Components
- **Chat Feature**: Complete chat functionality and components
- **Key Components**: Essential UI components used across applications

### Development Utilities
- **Constants**: Shared configuration and constant values
- **Translations**: Internationalization (i18n) resources
- **API Calls**: Centralized API service layer
- **State Management**: Shared state management utilities
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for common functionality
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions
- **Utils**: Utility functions and helpers

## Important Distinction

**This library should not be confused with our design system**, which contains:
- Core UI elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Visual design patterns

The design system focuses on visual consistency and basic UI components, while this shared library focuses on functional components, business logic, and application-specific features.

## Usage

This library is designed to be consumed by Little World's frontend applications, providing a centralized source of truth for shared functionality and components.

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
